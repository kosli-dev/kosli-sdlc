## Background

Segregations of duties is a common requirement in regulated or high security
development environment. Put plainly, it means that a developer cannot deploy
their own changes without approval from someone who both:

* Understands what is changing
* Accepts the risk of the change

Deployment approval controls form a key role in the secure software development
lifecycle.  Its purpose is to ensure that risks around change are managed and
that change is an active decisions.

In highly sensitive software systems, more than one approver may be required.

## How we implement this control

Deployment approvals are

* We use git tags to trigger and record deployment approvals
* CI/CD pipelines generate attestations for approvals
