## Background

As part of normal software development, it can be necessary to gain remote access to runtime environments.  This can be for many reasons:

* Debugging the runtime environment
* Running migration scripts
* Inspecting the behaviour of running systems

This must be limited to authorized personnel and all activities performed should have full audit trails.

## How we implement this control

* Any remote shell session require SSO authentication and full adit trails are logged in Kosli here: https://app.kosli.com/kosli/audit-trails
* This forms part of our [System Access Control Policy](https://app.drata.com/policy-builder/18)
* All access audit trails are reviewed
