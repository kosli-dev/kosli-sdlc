## Background

The deployment steps in our pipelines automatically log all deployments, and we can also control that we only deploy software that is approved in the {{% param "csor"  %}} audit trail.

## How we implement this control

* We monitor production systems and automatically record a forensic history of all changes in Kosli using [environment monitoring](https://docs.kosli.com/getting_started/environments/)
    * Environment records can be found here: https://app.kosli.com/kosli/environments/
