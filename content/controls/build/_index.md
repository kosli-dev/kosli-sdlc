A secure build chain is critical to protect the software development lifecycle from threats like malware, unauthorized code changes, or supply chain attacks. 

It ensures that every stage, from code development to deployment, is safeguarded. 

Without a secure build chain, vulnerabilities can be introduced at various points, leading to compromised software that could be exploited by attackers, potentially resulting in data breaches, system disruptions, and reputational damage.
