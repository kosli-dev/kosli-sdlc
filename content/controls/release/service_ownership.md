## Background

In any governance system, risks are managed by controls. But humans are ultimately responsible.In this context there are many reasons to keep a register of service ownership in diverse software
landscapes:

* **Knowlege**: Who knows how this is supposed to work?  How can I get help with this system?
* **Incident**: Alerts are firing for a service, who do I contact?  What has changed lately?
* **Audit**: who is reponsible that the SDLC is followed for this service?

## How we implement this control

At this stage, as we have a relatively simple system and a single tech team, simply recording the services in [Kosli's environment monitoring]({{< ref "workload_monitoring.md" >}}) meets this need.
