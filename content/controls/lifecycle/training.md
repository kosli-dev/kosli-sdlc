The team study the [OWASP top 10 security risks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
and discuss their implications for our software development and operations, at least annually.  New employees and members of the tech team require this as part of our onboarding process.

## How we implement this control

* The activity and paritsipants will be logged in a Kosli audit trail.
* For new employees the OWASP top 10 will be done together with one of the other team members.
